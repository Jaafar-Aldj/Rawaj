1. "The Filmmaker's Handbook": Cinematography
Visual Vocabulary Cheat Sheet

Lighting:

Three-Point Lighting: Standard professional setup (Key, Fill, Backlight) for a clean, dimensional look.

High-Key Lighting: Bright, low-contrast, minimal shadows. Evokes positivity, cleanliness, and optimism.

Low-Key Lighting: High-contrast, dark tones, deep shadows. Evokes drama, mystery, seriousness, and tension.

Rembrandt Lighting: A specific low-key style creating a triangle of light on the cheek. Highly dramatic and artistic.

Golden Hour: Soft, warm, diffused light shortly after sunrise or before sunset. Evokes warmth, romance, nostalgia.

Blue Hour: Cool, soft, diffused light just before sunrise or after sunset. Evokes serenity, cold, or melancholy.

Volumetric Lighting: Visible light rays/beams (e.g., light through a dusty window). Adds depth and atmosphere.

Hard Lighting: Creates sharp, well-defined shadows. Intense and dramatic.

Softbox Lighting: Mimics diffuse, soft light from a large source. Flattering for portraits, clean product shots.

Neon Lighting: Use of neon signs and colors. Evokes cyberpunk, nightlife, urban, and retro aesthetics.

Camera & Lens:

Shot Type: Wide Shot, Full Shot, Medium Shot, Close-up, Extreme Close-up.

Angle: Eye-Level, Low Angle (powerful), High Angle (vulnerable), Dutch Angle (disorienting), Bird's-Eye View, Worm's-Eye View.

Lens Type:

Wide-Angle Lens (e.g., 24mm): Captures a broad field of view, can distort edges. Used for landscapes, establishing shots.

Telephoto Lens (e.g., 85mm, 200mm): Compresses depth, isolates subject. Used for portraits, sports, wildlife.

Macro Lens: For extreme close-ups, revealing fine details.

Prime Lens (e.g., 50mm f/1.8): Fixed focal length, often sharper with better low-light performance.

Composition & Focus:

Rule of Thirds: Placing key elements on intersecting grid lines.

Leading Lines: Using natural lines to guide the viewer's eye.

Depth of Field (DoF): The zone of acceptable sharpness.

Shallow Depth of Field / Bokeh (e.g., f/1.4, f/1.8): Blurs the background, isolates the subject. Creates a professional, cinematic feel.

Deep Depth of Field (e.g., f/11, f/22): Keeps both foreground and background sharp. Used for landscapes.

"If... Then..." Logic Rules for Visuals

IF the goal is to make the subject (person or product) appear heroic, powerful, or dominant, THEN use a Low Angle Shot with Hard Lighting.

IF the brand identity is clean, minimalist, and modern (e.g., Apple), THEN use High-Key Lighting or Softbox Lighting with a Deep Depth of Field.

IF the mood is nostalgic, romantic, or serene, THEN specify Golden Hour Lighting with a Telephoto Lens and Shallow Depth of Field (Bokeh).

IF the product is food, jewelry, or has intricate details, THEN use a Macro Lens, Shallow Depth of Field, and High Contrast to emphasize texture.

IF the scene is meant to be dramatic, mysterious, or serious, THEN use Low-Key Lighting, Rembrandt Lighting, and a cool color palette.

IF creating an establishing shot for a location, THEN use a Wide-Angle Lens from a High Angle or Bird's-Eye View.
