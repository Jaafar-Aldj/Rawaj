Senior Copywriter AI Agent: Tactical Copywriting Frameworks

This document provides a comprehensive technical summary of four tactical copywriting books, structured for vector embedding to power a Senior Copywriter AI Agent. The information is distilled into actionable psychological frameworks, logic rules, headline formulas, and platform-specific style guides to optimize for conversion.

1. "Cashvertising" by Drew Eric Whitman
Core Psychology Extraction

Whitman's approach is based on tapping into fundamental, hardwired human desires.

The Life Force 8 (LF8): These are the eight primal, biological desires that drive the majority of human behavior.[1][2][3][4]

Survival, enjoyment of life, life extension.

Enjoyment of food and beverages.

Freedom from fear, pain, and danger.

Sexual companionship.

Comfortable living conditions.

To be superior, winning, keeping up with the Joneses.

Care and protection of loved ones.

Social approval.

The 9 Learned Secondary Wants: These are culturally learned desires that are powerful but less urgent than the LF8.[1][2][3]

To be informed.

Curiosity.

Cleanliness of body and surroundings.

Efficiency.

Convenience.

Dependability/Quality.

Expression of beauty and style.

Economy/Profit.

Bargains.

"If... Then..." Logic Rules for Copywriting

IF the product is a security system, home insurance, or safety equipment, THEN trigger LF8 #3 (Freedom from fear, pain, and danger) and LF8 #7 (Care and protection of loved ones).

IF the product is a luxury car, designer clothing, or exclusive club membership, THEN trigger LF8 #6 (To be superior, winning) and LF8 #8 (Social approval).

IF the product is a fast food item or a gourmet coffee, THEN trigger LF8 #2 (Enjoyment of food and beverages) and the secondary want for 'Convenience'.

IF writing copy for a cleaning service or organizational software, THEN trigger LF8 #5 (Comfortable living conditions) and secondary wants for 'Cleanliness' and 'Efficiency'.

IF the product is a nutritional supplement or fitness program, THEN trigger LF8 #1 (Survival, life extension) and LF8 #4 (Sexual companionship).

IF the target audience is 'New Parents', THEN all copy must first address LF8 #7 (Care and protection of loved ones) before any other benefit.

IF the offer is a discount or special deal, THEN explicitly use words that trigger the secondary wants for 'Bargains' and 'Economy/Profit'.

2. "The Adweek Copywriting Handbook" by Joseph Sugarman
Core Psychology Extraction

Sugarman's methodology focuses on creating an irresistible reading experience that pulls the reader through the copy.

The Slippery Slide: The core concept that every element of the copy, from the headline to the first sentence to the last, must be so compelling that the reader cannot stop reading. The goal is to create "reading gravity."[5][6]

Psychological Triggers: Sugarman identifies numerous triggers to embed in copy to influence the reader. Key triggers include:

Curiosity: Plant "seeds of curiosity" to keep the reader engaged and wanting to find out what happens next.[7][8]

Honesty & Credibility: Be disarmingly honest to build trust. Specificity enhances credibility.[5][6]

Emotion: People buy on emotion and justify with logic. The copy must first create an emotional response.[6]

Storytelling: Use compelling narratives and anecdotes to draw the reader in and make the message relatable.[5]

Satisfaction Conviction: Show such supreme confidence in your product (e.g., strong guarantees) that the reader feels convinced of its value.[6]

"If... Then..." Logic Rules for Copywriting

IF writing the first sentence of any ad, THEN its sole purpose is to make the reader read the second sentence. It should be short, punchy, and curiosity-driven.

IF the copy feels flat or informational, THEN inject a "seed of curiosity" by asking a question, starting a story mid-thought (e.g., "It all started with a mistake..."), or making a surprising statement.

IF the product has a potential perceived flaw (e.g., high price), THEN address it with disarming honesty (e.g., "It's not cheap. Here's why.") to build trust.

IF writing a video script for Instagram/TikTok, THEN apply the 'Slippery Slide' by using a strong visual hook in the first 2 seconds, followed by quick cuts and a compelling narrative to maintain momentum.

IF the copy needs to build trust, THEN use ultra-specific details (e.g., "It increased efficiency by 37.4%" instead of "It increases efficiency") to enhance credibility.

3. "Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion" by Robert Cialdini
Core Psychology Extraction

Cialdini identified six universal principles of persuasion that guide human decision-making.[9][10][11][12]

Reciprocity: People feel obligated to give back to others who have first given to them.[9][10][11]

Scarcity: People want more of things they can have less of. Perceived scarcity generates demand.[10][11]

Authority: People follow the lead of credible, knowledgeable experts.[11][12]

Consistency: People like to be consistent with things they have previously said or done. Activated by small initial commitments.[10][13]

Liking: People prefer to say yes to those they know and like. Attractiveness, similarity, and praise are key factors.[11][13]

Social Proof (Consensus): When uncertain, people look to the actions and behaviors of others to determine their own.[12][13]

"If... Then..." Logic Rules for Copywriting

IF the product is limited in quantity or time, THEN apply 'Scarcity' with phrases like "Only 50 available," "Doors close Friday," or "While supplies last."

IF the goal is to generate leads, THEN use 'Reciprocity' by offering a free, valuable resource (e.g., ebook, checklist, webinar) in exchange for an email address.

IF the ad features an expert, celebrity, or has official certification, THEN highlight 'Authority' by explicitly stating their credentials (e.g., "Dr. Jane Smith recommends...", "As seen in Forbes").

IF writing a social media ad, THEN leverage 'Social Proof' by including the number of customers, positive reviews, or user-generated content (e.g., "Join 50,000 happy customers!").

IF creating a multi-step funnel, THEN use 'Consistency' by asking for a small initial commitment (e.g., "Click 'Yes' if you want to learn more") before asking for the sale.

IF writing an "About Us" page or a personal brand's social media caption, THEN apply 'Liking' by telling a relatable story, showing shared values, or using conversational language.

4. "Made to Stick" by Chip Heath & Dan Heath
Core Psychology Extraction

The SUCCESs framework outlines six principles to make ideas memorable and effective ("sticky").[14][15][16]

Simple: Find the core essence of the idea. Strip it down to its most critical component.[14][16]

Unexpected: Grab attention with surprise. Break a pattern. Use curiosity gaps.[15][17]

Concrete: Explain ideas in terms of human actions and sensory information. Use tangible examples.[14][18]

Credible: Give the idea believability. Use statistics, authoritative sources, or a "testable credential" the audience can verify themselves.[14][15]

Emotional: Make people feel something. Connect to their self-interest or identity.[14][15]

Stories: Use narratives as mental flight simulators, preparing the audience to act.[14][15][18]

"If... Then..." Logic Rules for Copywriting

IF the product is technically complex (e.g., SaaS, finance), THEN make the core benefit 'Simple' and 'Concrete' using an analogy (e.g., "It's like having a personal accountant in your pocket").

IF writing a headline or the first line of an ad, THEN make it 'Unexpected' by challenging a common assumption or stating a surprising fact.

IF making a claim about product benefits, THEN make it 'Credible' by using a specific statistic ("saves 3 hours per week") and 'Concrete' by explaining what the user can do with that saved time ("That's enough time to finally finish that novel").

IF the goal is to drive donations for a cause, THEN focus on the 'Emotional' story of one individual rather than abstract statistics about many.

IF explaining a process or demonstrating a product's use case, THEN frame it as a 'Story' with a clear beginning (the problem), middle (the solution), and end (the successful outcome).
