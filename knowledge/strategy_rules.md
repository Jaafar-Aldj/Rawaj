Creative Director AI Agent: Strategic Marketing Frameworks

This document provides a comprehensive technical summary of four seminal marketing books, structured for vector embedding to power a Creative Director AI Agent. The information is distilled into actionable frameworks, logic rules, and guidelines to inform high-level strategy, define campaign tone, ensure virality, and orchestrate creative sub-agents.

1. "Building a StoryBrand" by Donald Miller
Core Framework Extraction: The SB7 Framework

The StoryBrand 7-Part Framework (SB7) is a narrative structure that positions the customer as the hero of a story.[1][2][3][4][5] The brand's role is to be the guide who helps the hero overcome their challenges.[2][6][7]

A Character: The customer is the hero. The framework begins by defining what the customer (the hero) wants.[1][4][7][8]

Has a Problem: The hero is facing a problem that stands in their way.[1][4][7][8] This problem has external, internal, and philosophical dimensions.[2][7]

And Meets a Guide: The hero encounters a guide (the brand) who understands their problem and has the expertise to help them.[1][4][7][8]

Who Gives Them a Plan: The guide provides the hero with a simple plan to follow, which removes uncertainty.[1][9]

And Calls Them to Action: The guide clearly calls the hero to take a specific action.[1][4][8]

That Ends in Success: The framework outlines the successful outcome the hero will experience if they follow the plan.[1][3]

And Helps Them Avoid Failure: It also highlights the negative consequences of not taking action.[1][8]

"If... Then..." Logic Rules for AI Strategy

IF the campaign goal is lead generation, THEN the primary call-to-action must be direct and clear, and the plan should be a simple 3-step process.[9]

IF the customer persona is experiencing frustration or confusion, THEN the messaging should emphasize the 'internal problem' and how the brand provides a clear plan to alleviate that feeling.

IF the product is a commodity, THEN differentiate by focusing on the philosophical problem the brand solves and the aspirational identity the customer can achieve.

IF creating a website wireframe, THEN the initial view (above the fold) must answer three questions within five seconds: What do you offer? How will it make my life better? What do I need to do to buy it?[5]

The "Big Idea" Generator Checklist

A campaign concept is strong if it answers "YES" to all the following:

Is the customer the hero of the campaign narrative?

Does the campaign clearly define a problem the customer is facing?

Is the brand positioned as an experienced and empathetic guide?

Is there a simple, actionable plan presented to the customer?

Is there a clear and direct call to action?

Does the campaign vividly portray the success the customer will achieve?

Are the stakes clear, illustrating what can be avoided by using the product/service?

Do's and Don'ts
Do	Don't
DO center all messaging around the customer and their journey.	DON'T make the brand the hero of the story.
DO use empathetic and understanding language.	DON'T assume the customer understands how your brand can improve their life; tell them explicitly.[5]
DO provide a clear, step-by-step plan for engagement.	DON'T use jargon or overly complex language that creates confusion.
DO have a direct and unambiguous call to action.	DON'T have competing or multiple calls to action in the same communication.
2. "Contagious: Why Things Catch On" by Jonah Berger
Core Framework Extraction: The STEPPS Framework

Jonah Berger's research identifies six key principles that drive ideas and products to become contagious.[10][11][12]

Social Currency: People share things that make them look good, smart, or in-the-know.[9][11][12][13][14] This can be achieved by finding inner remarkability, using game mechanics, and making people feel like insiders.[13]

Triggers: Top of mind, tip of tongue.[9][11][13] Link the product or idea to common environmental cues.[13][15]

Emotion: When we care, we share. High-arousal emotions (both positive like awe and negative like anger) are more likely to be shared.[9][11][13][14][16]

Public: Built to show, built to grow.[9][13] Making things more observable makes them easier to imitate.[11][12]

Practical Value: People like to share useful information to help others.[9][11][13]

Stories: Information travels under the guise of what seems like idle chatter.[9] Craft a narrative that carries your idea.[9]

"If... Then..." Logic Rules for AI Strategy

IF the goal is long-term brand recall, THEN associate the brand with a high-frequency trigger.

IF the campaign is for a "boring" product, THEN focus on creating high 'Social Currency' by making the story around the product remarkable.

IF the target audience is highly engaged in a specific community, THEN leverage 'Public' by creating a visible symbol of brand usage.

IF the product has a clear and demonstrable benefit, THEN prioritize 'Practical Value' in the messaging.

The "Big Idea" Generator Checklist

A campaign concept has high viral potential if it answers "YES" to at least three of the following:

Does sharing this campaign make the user look smart, cool, or like an insider? (Social Currency)

Is the campaign linked to a common, everyday trigger? (Triggers)

Does the campaign evoke a high-arousal emotion like awe, excitement, or amusement? (Emotion)

Is there a public, visible element to the campaign that encourages imitation? (Public)

Does the campaign offer genuinely useful information or a solution to a common problem? (Practical Value)

Is the campaign's message embedded in a compelling and shareable story? (Stories)

Do's and Don'ts
Do	Don't
DO focus on the psychology of sharing and what motivates people to talk about things.[14]	DON'T rely solely on the influence of a few individuals; the message itself is key.
DO create content that is emotionally evocative and provides practical value.	DON'T create content that looks like a traditional advertisement, as people are less likely to share it.[11]
DO make the desired behavior or brand association public and observable.	DON't forget the power of offline word-of-mouth; not all virality happens online.[16]
DO embed the brand or product naturally within a larger, more engaging story.	DON'T just list features; focus on feelings and shareability.[9]
3. "This is Marketing" by Seth Godin
Core Framework Extraction: Key Principles

Godin's marketing philosophy is centered on empathy, service, and making a positive change for a specific audience.[17][18][19]

The Smallest Viable Audience: Focus on the smallest group of people who can sustain your business.[20][21][22] By serving this niche audience well, you create a loyal following that will spread the word.[21]

Empathy: The foundation of effective marketing is a deep understanding of the audience's worldview, desires, and needs.[18][23]

Status Roles: People make decisions based on their perceived status and how a product or service will affect it. Understand the different roles of status (affiliation, admiration, etc.) and how your offering impacts them.

Permission Marketing: Build relationships and trust by earning the privilege of delivering anticipated, personal, and relevant messages to people who actually want to get them.[17][24]

Storytelling that Resonates: Tell stories that align with the narrative your audience already believes about themselves.[24]

"If... Then..." Logic Rules for AI Strategy

IF launching a new product, THEN define the 'Smallest Viable Audience' and create a story that resonates with their specific worldview.[20]

IF the market is saturated, THEN lean into empathy to uncover an underserved need or desire within a niche audience.

IF the product is a luxury item, THEN the campaign must focus on how it enhances the user's status and affiliation within their desired tribe.

IF building an email list, THEN provide upfront value to earn permission before making a direct sales pitch.[24]

The "Big Idea" Generator Checklist

A campaign concept is strong according to Godin's principles if it answers "YES" to all of the following:

Is the campaign targeted at the 'Smallest Viable Audience'?

Does the campaign demonstrate genuine empathy for the audience's problems and worldview?

Does the messaging align with the audience's existing narratives and dreams?[20]

Does the campaign enhance the customer's desired status?

Would the target audience miss the brand if it were gone?[25]

Are you seeking to earn permission for an ongoing conversation rather than just interrupting?

Do's and Don'ts
Do	Don't
DO focus on the needs and desires of a specific, small audience.	DON'T try to be for everyone.[22]
DO act with empathy and aim to solve real problems.[18]	DON'T use manipulative or coercive tactics.
DO earn the trust and attention of your audience over time.[17]	DON'T focus on short-term gains at the expense of long-term relationships.
DO tell a story that your audience wants to hear and that makes them feel seen.	DON'T just talk about your product's features; sell the feeling it creates.[18]
4. "Ogilvy on Advertising" by David Ogilvy
Core Framework Extraction: Core Tenets

Ogilvy's approach is rooted in research, discipline, and the power of a single, compelling idea.

The Big Idea: Every effective campaign is built around a central, compelling concept that is simple, memorable, and resonates with the audience.[26][27] A "Big Idea" is essential for a campaign to be successful and not "pass like a ship in the night."[27]

Research: Ogilvy was a staunch advocate for research to understand the product, the competition, and the consumer.[28][29] This includes everything from product quality to consumer preferences.[28]

Give the Facts: Consumers are intelligent; provide them with the information they need to make a decision.[30] The more facts you tell, the more you sell.[30]

Brand Image: Every advertisement should be seen as a long-term investment in the personality of the brand.[30]

"If... Then..." Logic Rules for AI Strategy

IF the brief is complex with multiple objectives, THEN distill the strategy down to a single, powerful "Big Idea."

IF there is no existing consumer research, THEN prioritize gathering data on the target audience and product perception before creative development.

IF the product has a clear functional advantage, THEN the campaign should present the facts in a clear and persuasive manner.

IF the campaign is part of a long-term brand-building effort, THEN ensure the creative execution is consistent with the established brand image.

The "Big Idea" Generator Checklist

A campaign concept has a "Big Idea" if it answers "YES" to these five questions:

Did it make me gasp when I first saw it?[29]

Do I wish I had thought of it myself?[29]

Is it unique?[29][31]

Does it fit the strategy to perfection?[31]

Could it be used for 30 years?[29]

Do's and Don'ts
Do	Don't
DO your homework. Thoroughly research the product and the consumer.	DON'T be a bore. You cannot bore people into buying your product.[26]
DO make the product the hero and the focus of the advertisement.	DON'T let the creative execution overshadow the product and its benefits.
DO promise a clear benefit to the consumer in the headline.	DON'T write copy that you wouldn't want your own family to read; be truthful.[30]
DO think of every ad as a contribution to the long-term brand image.	DON'T create campaigns that are too complicated or try to achieve too many objectives at once.[30]
